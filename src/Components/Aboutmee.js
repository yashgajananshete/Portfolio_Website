        <p>Hello, <b>I'm Yash Gajanan Shete</b>, born and brought up in Amravati, Maharashtra. I recently graduated from Government College of Engineering, Amravati, and I am currently pursuing an internship at Cognizant Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in the Cognizant Infrastructure Services domain.</p>
        <p>My technical skills include proficiency in <b>C, C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS,</b> and intermediate knowledge of <b>JavaScript, React.js, JDBC, Python, TypeScript,</b> and basic knowledge of <b>Node.js</b>. In addition to my mechanical engineering background, I also hold certification in <b>Catia design software</b>.</p>
        <p>One of my significant achievements is the completion of various personal coding projects that can be found on my Projects page. Additionally, I was involved in a college project,<b> 'Design and Fabrication of Rocker Bogie Mechanism,'</b> which is designed to assist farmers in optimizing farming processes, saving time and effort.</p>
        <p>I am known for my strong work ethic, discipline, dedication, and problem-solving abilities. As I pursue a career in the IT sector as a developer, I aim to maintain a healthy work-life balance and continue to develop my skills.</p>
        <p>I've had leadership experiences as the captain of my department's cricket team in my final year, where we reached the semifinals. My journey of living away from my family since childhood has instilled in me responsibility and maturity at an early age.</p>
